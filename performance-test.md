# **Performance Test: Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (OCC vs. PCC)**


You can use **[Java's `ExecutorService`](https://www.baeldung.com/java-executor-service-tutorial)** to create multiple threads that execute transactions concurrently.

### **🔹 Step 1: Simulating Heavy Load for OCC**

Optimistic Concurrency Control allows multiple transactions to proceed simultaneously but checks for conflicts at commit time.

1️⃣ Create multiple threads that attempt to register the same player in a tournament.

2️⃣ Each thread:
- Reads the current tournament version.
- Tries to **register a player** using OCC logic (```UPDATE ... WHERE version = ?```).
- If the update fails, it retries the operation. 3️⃣ Measure time taken and log failed attempts.

**Java Code: OCC Simulation**

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    executor.submit(() -> {
        boolean success = false;
        while (!success) {
            success = updateTournamentOptimisticConcurrency(tournamentId, playerId);
        }
    });
}
executor.shutdown();
```


### **🔹 Step 2: Simulating Heavy Load for PCC**

Pessimistic Concurrency Control locks the row when a transaction starts, preventing other transactions from proceeding.

1️⃣ Create multiple threads attempting to update the same match result.
2️⃣ Each thread: 

- Executes a ```SELECT ... FOR UPDATE``` to lock the row.
- Updates the match result.
- Commits the transaction. 3️⃣ Measure how long transactions wait due to locks.

**Java Code: PCC Simulation**

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    executor.submit(() -> updateMatchResultPessimistically(matchId, winnerId));
}
executor.shutdown();
```


### **🔹 Step 3: Measure and Compare Performance**


After running both simulations:

- **Log the execution time** for each approach.
- **Count how many transactions failed and had to retry** (OCC).
- **Measure how many transactions had to wait** (PCC).


## **📌 Performance Comparison Table**
| **Metric**               | **Optimistic CC (OCC)** | **Pessimistic CC (PCC)** |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Execution Time**       | Fast/Slower? (Why) | Fast/Slower? (Why) |
| **Transaction Success Rate** | Lower/Higher? (Why) | Lower/Higher? (Why) |
| **Lock Contention**      | None/Low/High? | None/Low/High? |
| **Best Use Case**       | Read-heavy/Write-heavy? (use cases) | Read-heavy/Write-heavy? (use cases) |
